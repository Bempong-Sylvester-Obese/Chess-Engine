# Chess Engine with Real-time Analysis

This document describes the real-time analysis features that have been integrated into the main chess game (`main.py`).

## New Features

### 1. Real-time Position Analysis
- **Current Evaluation**: Shows the numerical evaluation of the current position
- **Position Assessment**: Provides a human-readable assessment (e.g., "White is winning", "Equal position")
- **Game Status**: Displays current game state (Check, Checkmate, Stalemate, etc.)

### 2. Move Suggestions
- **Top 3 Moves**: Shows the best 3 moves for the current player
- **Move Evaluations**: Each suggested move includes its evaluation score
- **Color Coding**: 
  - Green: Good moves (positive evaluation)
  - Red: Bad moves (negative evaluation)
  - White: Neutral moves (zero evaluation)

### 3. Move History
- **Recent Moves**: Displays the last 10 moves in algebraic notation
- **Move Numbers**: Shows move numbers for easy reference

### 4. Enhanced User Interface
- **Analysis Panel**: Dedicated panel on the right side of the screen
- **Larger Window**: Increased window size to accommodate analysis (1000x800)
- **Professional Layout**: Clean, organized display of analysis information

## How to Use

### Starting the Game
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the chess game with analysis
python main.py
```

### Controls
- **Mouse**: Click to select pieces and make moves
- **R Key**: Reset the game to starting position
- **U Key**: Undo the last move
- **Close Window**: Exit the game

### Understanding the Analysis

#### Evaluation Scores
- **Positive values**: White is ahead
- **Negative values**: Black is ahead
- **Zero**: Equal position
- **Large values (>3.0)**: Significant advantage
- **Very large values (>1000)**: Checkmate

#### Position Assessment
- **"White/Black is winning"**: Large advantage (>3.0)
- **"White/Black is better"**: Small advantage (1.0-3.0)
- **"Equal position"**: Balanced position (<1.0)

#### Game Status
- **Normal**: Regular game in progress
- **Check**: King is under attack
- **Checkmate**: Game over, king is checkmated
- **Stalemate**: Game over, no legal moves
- **Insufficient Material**: Game over, cannot checkmate

## Technical Details

### Engines Used
1. **Enhanced Engine**: Uses machine learning model trained on chess data
   - Combines material evaluation with learned positional features
   - More sophisticated evaluation than basic engine
   - Falls back to basic engine if model is unavailable

2. **Basic Engine**: Simple material-based evaluation
   - Counts piece values
   - Used as fallback when enhanced engine fails

### Analysis Update
- Analysis is updated automatically after each move
- Real-time evaluation of current position
- Immediate move suggestions for current player

### Performance
- Analysis updates are fast and responsive
- No noticeable lag during gameplay
- Efficient use of computational resources

## Testing

Run the test script to verify all analysis features work correctly:

```bash
python test_analysis_integration.py
```

This will test:
- Engine initialization
- Starting position analysis
- Position analysis after moves
- Checkmate detection
- Stalemate detection

## Files Modified

- `main.py`: Main chess game with integrated analysis
- `test_analysis_integration.py`: Test script for analysis features

## Dependencies

All required dependencies are already included in `requirements.txt`:
- `python-chess`: Chess game logic
- `pygame`: GUI framework
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning model
- `numpy`: Numerical computations
- `pandas`: Data handling

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the analysis system:
1. **Depth Analysis**: Show evaluation at different search depths
2. **Opening Database**: Integrate opening theory and suggestions
3. **Endgame Tablebases**: Perfect play in endgame positions
4. **Position Comparison**: Compare current position with similar positions
5. **Blunder Detection**: Highlight obvious mistakes
6. **Time Management**: Suggest moves based on time remaining
